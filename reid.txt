[1mPython III: Data Science - Pigg A:[0m

Reid,
This course builds on skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses. The topics have challenged you to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications. As a student, you should know more advanced data structures and object-oriented programming basics. You also learned to communicate with popular APIs including Twitter and Google in order to “grab” data and to organize the data and display it. 

A learning outcome at which you show strength is identifying/characterizng/defining a programming problem. You also always are good at finding errors in class. 
A learning outcome at which you could improve in the future is working to expressing creativity using coding and technology in a variety of contexts. 

You've shown some growth with your exams over the course of this semester. Your final grade in this class is 90%, which ends up being the letter grade A-. As you think about and plan for courses next year, I hope you consider some of the Computer Science electives like Algorithms and Machine Learning!
