[1mPython III: Data Science - Pigg A:[0m

Tiger T,
This course builds on skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses. The topics have challenged you to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications. As a student, you should know more advanced data structures and object-oriented programming basics. You also learned to communicate with popular APIs including Twitter and Google in order to “grab” data and to organize the data and display it. 

A learning outcome at which you show strength is identifying and repairing coding errors in a program. You also always work collaboratively in class. 
A learning outcome at which you could improve in the future is working to designing, documenting, implementing, and testing solutions to programming problems. 

You've shown amazing growth with your exams over the course of this semester! Your final grade in this class is 88%, which ends up being the letter grade B+. As you think about and plan for courses next year, I hope you consider some of the Computer Science electives like Algorithms and Machine Learning!
